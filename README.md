# Squads Mod

TBD

## Build Requirements

* fteqcc - make sure it's in your `PATH` if you want to use the Makefile!

## Building

### Linux/Cygwin/Anything with `make`

Run `make` from the root directory. If you have a Quake installation,
you can also run
```
QUAKEDIR=/path/to/quake/root make install
```
to install the mod, although you'll still be missing assets (see below).

### Anywhere

Run `fteqcc -o progs.dat` from the root directory.
